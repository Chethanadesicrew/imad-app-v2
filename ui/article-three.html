                    Spear fisherman Danny Henricks is fortunate enough to have survived the type of underwater experience that proves just how dangerous sea creatures can be -- and he even caught it all on video.
                    Henricks, 35, was fishing off the coast of Australia when a bull shark charged at him at full speed, only to impale himself on Danny's spear gun.
                    The hair-raising clip has been video more than three million times (and counting) since Henricks uploaded it last month.

                We understand that it can be a struggle when you are forced to turn your phone off when flying.
                But in China it could cost you a hefty sum, plus five days in jail - and two people flying to Beijing found that out the hard way.
                According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China, one passenger was held for five days for just listening to music.
                The passenger was arrested earlier this month, at Beijing Capital International Airport.
                Another passenger heading to Beijing reportedly got the same penalty for using her phone and refusing to turn it off.
                The fine is believed to be around £5000.
                In China, that's the law.
